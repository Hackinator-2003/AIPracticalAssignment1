Playing the game is simple. First, you got three choices: 

1)	Run it through an windows executable file game_app.exe that you will find in the folder EXECUTABLE_APP in the project folder.

2)	Run it through the Python Script main.py in the PYTHON folder in the project folder. Nevertheless, to run the project through this, you must have the: tkinter, random, PIL and pyglet libraries already installed on your device.

3)	Run the Shortcut Game in the PROJECT_FOLDER.

When you will run the app, through whatever technique you want, it will open a window where youâ€™ll see the main UI as presented before.
